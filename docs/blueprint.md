## Core Features:

- Template Selection: Display a grid of pre-designed certificate templates (3-5).
- Real-time Preview: A real-time preview updates as the user customizes the text fields.
- Certificate Customization: The app enables certificate text customization, plus basic color and font styling options.
- AI-Powered Improvement Tool: Use AI as a tool to check and provide feedback on the customization and advise the user on visual and semantic improvements (tone, terminology, content relevance).
- Single Certificate Generation: Enable generation and PDF download for single certificates via form input.
- Bulk Certificate Generation: Allow bulk certificate generation by uploading a CSV file with recipient data and names. High-quality PDF downloads are still mandatory.
- Download Certificates: Users can download certificates individually and in bulk as ZIP files.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 75%, 50%) which converts to a vibrant blue (#3399FF), chosen to inspire trust and professionalism, key in a certification app.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) converting to a very light blue (#F0F8FF). This nearly white background creates a clean, uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 65%, 40%) converting to a teal (#2FCFBF), for interactive elements. This contrast highlights important UI elements without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look; suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clean icons to represent different actions, such as 'download,' 'customize,' and 'generate.'
- Use a grid-based layout for template selection and ensure a clear hierarchy for customization options.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states and transitions to improve user experience.
